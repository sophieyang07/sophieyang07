# Hi, I'm Sophie 👋

I'm Sophie Yang (sophieyang07), an undergraduate studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences at [UC Berkeley](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/). I enjoy building things that live on the web — especially fun, interactive projects tied to the fandoms I'm part of.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Languages**: JavaScript, Python, C++, learning Rust
- **Interests**: Web development, UI/UX design, systems programming

### 🌱 Currently
- Exploring Rust through small CLI and web projects
- Learning about hardware-software interaction and embedded systems

### 💼 Experience
- **Software Engineering Intern**, Spring 2025  
  Contributed to internal tooling at a mid-stage startup, focusing on front-end JavaScript optimisation and automated test integration.

### 📁 Projects
- **Fandom Archive**  
  A personal web app to collect and organise fanart, fanfic, and discussion links across multiple fandoms. Built with React, hosted via Vercel.

- **Campus Energy Visualiser**  
  Visualises real-time energy usage data for UC Berkeley buildings. Built using Python (Flask) with a JavaScript D3.js front-end.

### 🔍 Outside of Code
- Sketching and digital art — occasionally post fanart online
- Read a lot of speculative fiction (favourites include *The Locked Tomb* series and *Blame!*)
- Currently teaching myself Rust through Advent of Code challenges
